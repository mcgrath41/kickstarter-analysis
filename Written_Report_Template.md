# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Statistical analysis of kickstarter campaigns via Excel.  

### Purpose

To put into perspective the failed kickstarter campaign for Louise's play, Fever.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

After filtering the dataset to include only theater-related campaigns, we can better understand if a theater campaign's launch date has any impact on its perfomrance. This was completed by grouping these campaigns by the month in which they were launched and by outcome via PivotTable. The following Line Chart was then created to better visualize this tabular data:

![](/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Next, we filtered down a step further to only include "plays" within the parent category "theater" to analyze how campaigns directly-related to that of Louise's play, Fever, have fared. These campaigns were grouped by Goal amount and by outcome which allowed us to calculate the success-rate of kickstarter campaigns for plays of similar sizes/expectations. To visualize this analysis, a second Line Chart was then created which can be found below:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?



- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?



- What are some limitations of this dataset?



- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
